# Hi! I'm Talal 👋

I'm a beginner developer currently learning how to build things for the web. I'm documenting my journey here on GitHub as I move from basic websites to more complex apps.

### 🛠 What I'm using right now
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Frameworks:** Bootstrap
- **Databases:** MongoDB and MySQL.

### 📚 Currently Learning

**New Languages:**
- Java
- Python

**Backend & Tools:**
- Node.js
- Shell scripting (using Ubuntu)

### 🚀 My Big Goal
I am currently working on a **full-scale E-commerce website**. I want to use everything I've learned to build a shop from scratch, and I'll be updating it as I learn new tools like Docker and Node.js.
